# UDACITY'S NEIGHBORHOOD PROJECT

>## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Here we have created a simple web page that lists the name of friends which have been stored in the file. A map on the right with the markers representing the cities in which these friends live. A search box on the left hand side which allows to filter the cities in which the friends live and filtering the markers on the map as well. A simple hover over the markers display a little information about the friends but a click on the marker on the map displays a little more information. To see what additional information. Find out yourself!

>## LEARNING OUTCOMES

Here we started with the development of the webpage using `HTML 5` and `CSS`. Then we used `Google Maps API` for rendering the map and also the `FourSquare API` for getting additional information which is basically about the 2 near points with the distance as well shown with the info. The use of these API is made possible with `Javascript`. The project could have been made with simple javascript as well but we adhered to the use of `Knockout JS` of MVVM paradigm. Also Made use of a few `AJAX` methods and `JSON` with the javascript. To handle the errors regarding the 'FourSquare API' we used `JQUERY` a little.
